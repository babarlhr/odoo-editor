- Test and fix Enter & Backspace on mobiles
    - works on all tested chrome: samsung A9 gboard, huawei A7 gboard, & swipe
    - issues on Firefox for Android, with gboard
- Fix `ab<br>[] cd` + backspace = `ab cd` problem -> remove *following* invisible space before backspace command
- Implement ForwardDelete and refactor invisible space & empty blocks in the process
- Fix known bugs
    - issue with "<p>te[]st</p>" then enter-backspace-enter-enter (the cursor is not set on the right node)
    - cursor issue on rollback (ex: when Enter in empty <td> (works for shift-Enter, but not Enter that is similar: catched/rollbacked/shift-Enter)
- fix undo: push the reverse operation in the history (instead of removing from history): that should fix collaborative undo too
- Implement "attributes" in mutationRecords
- sanitizer: sanitize sibling <ul> (directly or indirectly): or handle that in backspace?
