- Test Enter & Backspace on mobiles and fix issues (uncomment keypress backspace to use input handler)
- Fix issue with "<p>te[]st</p>" then enter-backspace-enter-enter (the cursor is not set on the right node)
- fix undo: push the reverse operation in the history (instead of removing from history): that should fix collaborative undo too
- Implement "attributes" in mutationRecords
- Test extensively on mobile
- Implement ForwardDelete and cleanup utils code
